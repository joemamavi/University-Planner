# 🎓 CampusOS

**The Operating System for Your Academic Life.**

CampusOS is a smart, Flask-based student productivity dashboard designed to go beyond simple to-do lists. It actively manages your attendance risk, optimizes your schedule, prioritizes tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, and helps you track career achievements—all in one PWA-ready application.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **"Safe to Bunk" Calculator:** Tells you exactly how many classes you can miss while maintaining 75% attendance, or warns you when you are in the "Danger Zone".
* **✈️ Holiday Forecaster:** A simulation algorithm that accepts date ranges for planned leaves and predicts which specific subjects will drop below the attendance threshold.

### ⚡ Productivity Tools
* **Prioritization Matrix:** An interactive **Eisenhower Matrix** (Drag & Drop) to categorize tasks into *Do First, Schedule, Delegate,* and *Delete*.
* **Bottleneck Alerts:** Automatically detects "High Pressure" days (3+ deadlines) and displays a warning banner on the dashboard.
* **Gap Finder:** Scans your daily timetable to identify free time slots, suggesting when to fit in productivity tasks.

### 📅 Scheduling & Career

* **Calendar Integration:** A unified view of academic events and assignment deadlines.
* **💼 Career Vault:** A dedicated log for hackathons, projects, and internships to keep your resume data organized.
